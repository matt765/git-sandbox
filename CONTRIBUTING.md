# Contributing Guide

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ First of all â€” thank you for considering contributing to this project. Every bit of help is appreciated and valued.

This guide is here to explain how contributions work and to make sure we're all on the same page when it comes to collaboration and licensing.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before a contribution can be accepted, signing the project's Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is required.

**Why do we need this?**
This project uses a dual-license model (AGPL-3.0 and Commercial). To ensure the necessary rights are in place to include contributions in both versions, a CLA is required. The CLA is a simple agreement that grants the project owner a license to the contribution, allowing the code to be distributed under both licenses. This protects the contributor, the project, and its users.

**How to sign?**
The process is automated. When you open your first Pull Request, a bot will comment with a link to sign the CLA. It's a quick, one-time process.

## How to Contribute

1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature`).
3.  Make your changes.
4.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some awesome feature'`).
5.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-awesome-feature`).
6.  Open a Pull Request. The CLA bot will guide you from there if needed.

## Other Ways to Support the Project

Even if you're not contributing code, there are still valuable ways to get involved:

- **Open an issue** with feedback, suggestions, or bug reports â€” your input helps improve the project for everyone.
- **Support the project** through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/matt765) to help keep development active.

Every form of support means a lot and helps keep this project alive and growing.

## A Note of Thanks

Thanks again for taking the time to contribute!
