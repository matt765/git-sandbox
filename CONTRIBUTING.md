# Contributing guide

Hi there! 👋 Thanks for checking out this project.  
Every form of contribution is valuable. Below are the main ways to get involved:


## 1. Share Feedback and Ideas 💡

- Use the **[Discussions](https://github.com/matt765/git-sandbox/discussions/1)** on GitHub to share feedback, suggestions, or ideas for improvement.
- Open an **Issue** if you’ve found a bug or something doesn’t work as expected.


## 2. Support Development 🔥

If you’d like to support continued work on the project, you can do so through [**GitHub Sponsors**](https://github.com/sponsors/matt765).


## 3. Contribute Translations 🌍

Translations make the app more accessible to people worldwide.  
Pull requests may be submitted for adding new languages or improving existing ones in the `i18n/` folder.

### Licensing for Translations

By submitting translations, the contributor agrees that:

1. The contribution is dedicated to the public domain under **CC0-1.0**
2. The contributor confirms authorship of the translation and that it does not infringe third-party rights.
3. These terms apply **only to translations**.  All other parts of the project remain licensed under **AGPL-3.0**.

For some time, I will hold off on accepting merge requests for application's core code. While I greatly appreciate your willingness to contribute code, I am currently focused on managing the project's development internally. This may change in the future.
